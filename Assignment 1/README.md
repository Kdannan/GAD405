To get the code for randomising the background colours when the page is clicked.
https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-interactivity-1.html




-----------------------------------------------------------------
When the code is opened it should produce a screen where a square is moving diagonally downwards. Then when it reaches the edge of the canvas the square should reset in a new position on the left hand side of the canvas.
The background colour is interactive. So when the user clicks anywhere on the screen the colour changes randomly.
